# tf_catdog
A tensorflow / tflearn example that distinguishes between cats and dogs. 

This code was heavily inspired by this tutorial:

Obviously this requires quite a few libraries, but it wasn't anything I couldn't get off pip. After installing CUDA 9.0 and 64 bit Python3 (which I already had for caffe) I used pip to get
- opencv and numpy (which I also had from caffe)
- tensorflow-gpu
- tflearn
- matplotlib
